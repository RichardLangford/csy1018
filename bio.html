  <!-- about me -->
  <p>I am personable, sociable and a team player with good communication skills and a positive but thoughtful, considered approach to life. I am used to interacting with members of the public, understanding their needs and providing first class customer service. I have worked for Tesco Northampton South recently for two years, whilst I studied for a BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Networking and Systems Support at Northampton College, after my GCSEâ€™s. I replenished Fresh Provisions, and assisted with stock control and stock reductions during the twilight shifts and Sundays. Consequently I received training in customer service skills, and I understand the value and impact of excellent customer service. I am confident interacting with customers and listening to their needs, in order to help them and give first class service. As I am multi-skilled, during Christmas 2015, I worked on checkouts for Nick Fox as a Christmas temp, working a variety of shifts, ranging from early morning starts to late finishes. I studied at Northampton College for two years for the BTEC Extended Diploma in Computing and Networking skills at Northampton College. I am very interested in information technology, and I built my own computer, purchasing individual components and assembling it myself. I also enjoy motorbikes, and saved up for and purchased my own R125 motorbike whilst at college, attaining the national motorcycle driver training qualification after training at The Obelisk. I consider myself a careful motorcycle rider, and I enjoyed modifying it. I fitted a camera to the bike and videoed many of my journeys to improve my own driving skills, and to evaluate the driving skills of other people. </p>
